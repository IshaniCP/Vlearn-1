Voice Based Solution for Blind and Disabled 

#Overview

Vlearn - Learn better than you have vision. This system will help blind and disabled users to satisfy the day to day needs in the Internet. Nowadays they use Braille keyboards and screen readers. However, these solutions are not comfortable for this users. We are providing a voice based solution to use the internet easily for those people.
For now, we are focusing on facebook, the largest social network popular among people. Later we are going to integrate this for many websites and web applications.

#How to use

We are going to create a backend to handle various APIs.
Eg  Facebook graph API
      Google voice API
      Speech Recognition API etc
Each user has a account with his details. Age, Academic Status, Religion, Languages, and His interests. According to those interests, backend is interacting with other APIs and provide voice as a output.
For now we are implementing simply login to facebook and get current notifications, read News Feed, Read Messages, etc. through the voice commands.
Practically, integrate our system to every website is hard. So we have to make every website into a common architecture which mean those sites should have a common API. In future we will plan integrate Machine Learning and Neural networks and deep learning. So user can interact with the Internet like a normal person.
Imagine you want to buy a T-shirt from Ebay but you are blind. But you are using Vlearn and you can hear every detail about T Shirts in the ebay and you can find a T-shirt with perfect fit.
